## Classes

### backuppc::client

Configures a host for backup with the backuppc server.
Uses storedconfigs to provide the backuppc server with
required information.

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `backuppc::client` class.

##### `ensure`

Data type: `Any`

Present or absent.

Default value: 'present'

##### `config_name`

Data type: `Any`

TODO

Default value: $facts['networking']['fqdn']

##### `backuppc_hostname`

Data type: `Any`

TODO

Default value: ''

##### `client_name_alias`

Data type: `Any`

Override the client's host name. This allows multiple clients to all
refer to the same physical host. This should only be set in the per-PC
config file and is only used by BackupPC at the last moment prior to
generating the command used to backup that machine (ie: the value of
$Conf{ClientNameAlias} is invisible everywhere else in BackupPC).
he setting can be a host name or IP address. eg.
      $Conf{ClientNameAlias} = 'realHostName';
      $Conf{ClientNameAlias} = '192.1.1.15';

will cause the relevant smb/tar/rsync backup/restore commands
to be directed to realHostName, not the client name.
Note: this setting doesn't work for hosts with DHCP set to 1.

Default value: `false`

##### `system_account`

Data type: `Any`

Name of the user that will be created to allow backuppc
access to the system via ssh. This only applies to xfer
methods that require it. To override this set the system_account
to an empty string and configure access to the client yourself as
the default in the global config file (root) or change the
rsync_client_cmd or tar_client_cmd to suit your setup.

Default value: 'backup'

##### `system_home_directory`

Data type: `Any`

Absolute path to the home directory of the system account.

Default value: '/var/backups'

##### `system_additional_commands`

Data type: `Any`

Additional sudo commands to whitelist for the system_account. This
is useful if you need to execute any pre dump *scripts* on client before
backup. Please prefer system_additional_commands_noexec if you want
to whitelist a single command/binary since commands specified here
are going to be allowed without the NOEXEC options. See man sudoers
for details.

Default value: []

##### `system_additional_commands_noexec`

Data type: `Any`

Additional sudo commands to whitelist for the system_account. This
is useful if you need to execute any pre dump commands on client before
backup.

Default value: []

##### `manage_sudo`

Data type: `Any`

Boolean. Set to true to configure and install sudo and the
sudoers.d directory. Defaults to false and is only applied
if 1) xfer_method requires ssh access and 2) you're using
the system_account parameter.

Default value: `false`

##### `manage_rsync`

Data type: `Any`

Boolean. By default will install the rsync package. If you
manage this elsewhere set it to false. Defaults to true and
is only applied if 1) the xfer_method is rsync and 2) you're
using the system_account parameter.

Default value: `true`

##### `blackout_bad_ping_limit`

Data type: `Any`

To allow for periodic rebooting of a PC or other brief periods when a
PC is not on the network, a number of consecutive bad pings is allowed
before the good ping count is reset.

Default value: `false`

##### `blackout_periods`

Data type: `Any`

One or more blackout periods can be specified. If a client is subject
to blackout then no regular (non-manual) backups will be started
during any of these periods. hourBegin and hourEnd specify hours fro
midnight and weekDays is a list of days of the week where 0 is Sunday,
1 is Monday etc.
To specify one blackout period from 7:00am to 7:30pm local time on Mon-Fri.
  $Conf{BlackoutPeriods} = [
       {
           hourBegin =>  7.0,
           hourEnd   => 19.5,
           weekDays  => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
       },
  ];

Default value: `false`

##### `ping_max_msec`

Data type: `Any`

Maximum latency between backuppc server and client to schedule
a backup. Default to 20ms.

Default value: `false`

##### `ping_cmd`

Data type: `Any`

Ping command. The following variables are substituted at run-time:
   $pingPath      path to ping ($Conf{PingPath})
   $host          host name
Wade Brown reports that on solaris 2.6 and 2.7 ping -s returns the
wrong exit status (0 even on failure). Replace with "ping $host 1",
which gets the correct exit status but we don't get the round-trip time.
Note: all Cmds are executed directly without a shell, so the prog
name needs to be a full path and you can't include shell syntax like
redirection and pipes; put that in a script if you need it.

Default value: `false`

##### `backups_disable`

Data type: `Any`

Disable all full and incremental backups. These settings are useful
for a client that is no longer being backed up (eg: a retired machine),
but you wish to keep the last backups available for browsing or
restoring to other machines.

Data type: `Any`

How many BackupPC_nightly processes to run in parallel. Each night,
at the first wakeup listed in $Conf{WakeupSchedule}, BackupPC_nightly
is run. Its job is to remove unneeded files in the pool, ie: files that
only have one link. To avoid race conditions, BackupPC_nightly and BackupPC_link
cannot run at the same time. Starting in v3.0.0, BackupPC_nightly can run
concurrently with backups (BackupPC_dump).

Default value: 2

##### `backuppc_nightly_period`

Data type: `Any`

How many days (runs) it takes BackupPC_nightly to traverse the entire pool.
Normally this is 1, which means every night it runs, it does traverse the entire
pool removing unused pool files.

Default value: 1

##### `max_old_log_files`

Data type: `Any`

Maximum number of log files we keep around in log directory. These files are aged
nightly. A setting of 14 means the log directory will contain about 2 weeks of old
log files, in particular at most the files LOG, LOG.0, LOG.1, ... LOG.13 (except today's
LOG, these files will have a .z extension if compression is on).

Default value: 14

##### `df_max_usage_pct`

Data type: `Any`

Maximum threshold for disk utilization on the __TOPDIR__ filesystem. If the output
from $Conf{DfPath} reports a percentage larger than this number then no new regularly
scheduled backups will be run. However, user requested backups (which are usually
incremental and tend to be small) are still performed, independent of disk usage. Also,
currently running backups will not be terminated when the disk usage exceeds this number.

Default value: 95

##### `trash_clean_sleep_sec`

Data type: `Any`

How long BackupPC_trashClean sleeps in seconds between each check of the trash directory.

Default value: 300

hashes for each class C address range. This is only needed if hosts in the conf/hosts
file have the dhcp flag set.

Default value: []

##### `full_period`

Data type: `Any`

Minimum period in days between full backups. A full dump will only be done if at least
this much time has elapsed since the last full dump, and at least $Conf{IncrPeriod}
days has elapsed since the last successful dump.

Default value: '6.97'

##### `full_keep_cnt`

Data type: `Any`

Number of full backups to keep.

Default value: [1]

at least $Conf{FullKeepCntMin} full backups no matter how old they are.

Default value: 90

##### `incr_period`

Data type: `Any`

Minimum period in days between incremental backups (a user requested incremental
backup will be done anytime on demand).

Default value: '0.97'

##### `incr_keep_cnt`

Data type: `Any`

Number of incremental backups to keep.

Default value: 6

##### `incr_age_max`

Data type: `Any`

we keep at least $Conf{IncrKeepCntMin} incremental backups no matter how old
they are.

Default value: 30

##### `incr_levels`

Data type: `Any`

A full backup has level 0. A new incremental of level N will backup all files
that have changed since the most recent backup of a lower level.

Default value: [1]

##### `partial_age_max`

Data type: `Any`

A failed full backup is saved as a partial backup. The rsync XferMethod can
take advantage of the partial full when the next backup is run. This parameter
sets the age of the partial full in days: if the partial backup is older than
this number of days, then rsync will ignore (not use) the partial full when the
next backup is run. If you set this to a negative value then no partials will be
saved. If you set this to 0, partials will be saved, but will not be used by the
next backup.

Default value: 3

##### `incr_fill`

Data type: `Any`

Boolean. Whether incremental backups are filled. "Filling" means that the most recent fulli
(or filled) dump is merged into the new incremental dump using hardlinks. This
makes an incremental dump look like a full dump.

Default value: `false`

##### `restore_info_keep_cnt`

Data type: `Any`

Number of restore logs to keep. BackupPC remembers information about each restore
request. This number per client will be kept around before the oldest ones are pruned.

Default value: 10

##### `archive_info_keep_cnt`

Data type: `Any`

Number of archive logs to keep. BackupPC remembers information about each archive request.
This number per archive client will be kept around before the oldest ones are pruned.

Default value: 10

##### `blackout_good_cnt`

Data type: `Any`

PCs that are always or often on the network can be backed up after hours, to reduce PC,
network and server load during working hours. For each PC a count of consecutive good
pings is maintained. Once a PC has at least $Conf{BlackoutGoodCnt} consecutive good pings
it is subject to "blackout" and not backed up during hours and days specified by $Conf{BlackoutPeriods}.

Default value: 7

##### `blackout_periods`

Data type: `Any`

TODO

Default value: [ { hourBegin =>  7.0,

##### `backup_zero_files_is_fatal`

Data type: `Any`

Boolean. A backup of a share that has zero files is considered fatal. This is used to catch miscellaneous Xfer
errors that result in no files being backed up. If you have shares that might be
empty (and therefore an empty backup is valid) you should set this to false.

Default value: `true`

Data type: `Any`

Whether the exit status of each PreUserCmd and PostUserCmd is checked.
If set and the Dump/Restore/Archive Pre/Post UserCmd returns a non-zero exit status then the dump/restore/archive is aborted. To maintain backward compatibility (where the exit status in early versions was always ignored), this flag defaults to 0.
If this flag is set and the Dump/Restore/Archive PreUserCmd fails then the matching Dump/Restore/Archive PostUserCmd is not executed. If DumpPreShareCmd returns a non-exit status, then DumpPostShareCmd is not executed, but the DumpPostUserCmd is still run (since DumpPreUserCmd must have previously succeeded).
An example of a DumpPreUserCmd that might fail is a script that snapshots or dumps a database which fails because of some database error.

Default value: `true`

## Data types

### Backuppc::BlackoutPeriods

Blackout Periods
One or more blackout periods can be specified. If a client is subject to blackout
then no regular (non-manual) backups will be started during any of these periods.
hourBegin and hourEnd specify hours from midnight and weekDays is a list of days of
the week where 0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday etc.
For example:

This specifies one blackout period from 7:00am to 7:30pm local time on Mon-Fri, and
a second period from 11pm to 5am on Friday and Saturday night.

#### Examples

##### Specify one blackout period from 7:00am to 7:30pm local time on Mon-Fri.

```puppet
blackout_periods => [
     {
         hourBegin =>  7.0,
         hourEnd   => 19.5,
         weekDays  => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
     },
];
```

##### The blackout period can also span midnight by setting hourBegin > hourEnd, eg:

```puppet
blackout_periods => [
     {
         hourBegin =>  7.0,
         hourEnd   => 19.5,
         weekDays  => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
     },
     {
         hourBegin => 23,
         hourEnd   =>  5,
         weekDays  => [5, 6],
     },
];
```

Alias of `Array[Struct[{
    hourBegin => Numeric[0,24],
    hourEnd   => Numeric[0,24],
    weekDays  => Array[Integer[0,6]]
  }]]`

### Backuppc::DhcpAddressRange

DHCP Address Range
This is an array of hashes for each class C address range. This is only needed
if hosts in the conf/hosts file have the dhcp flag set.

#### Examples

##### to specify 192.10.10.20 to 192.10.10.250 as the DHCP address pool

```puppet
dhcp_address_ranges => [
    {
        ipAddrBase => '192.10.10',
        first => 20,
        last  => 250,
    },
];
```

##### to specify two pools (192.10.10.20-250 and 192.10.11.10-50)

```puppet
dhcp_address_ranges => [
    {
        ipAddrBase => '192.10.10',
        first => 20,
        last  => 250,
    },
    {
        ipAddrBase => '192.10.11',
        first => 10,
        last  => 50,
    },
];
```

Alias of `Array[Struct[{
    ipAddressBase => Pattern[/\A([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|1[0-9]{2}|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])(\.([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|1[0-9]{2}|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])){2}\z/],
    first => Integer[0,255],
    last => Integer[0,255]
  }]]`

### Backuppc::XferLogLevel

Xfer Log Level
0 means be quiet, 1 will give will give one line per file, 2 will also show skipped files
on incrementals, higher values give more output.

Alias of `Integer[0, 2]`

### Backuppc::XferMethod

Numeric user ID.
If you have a mixed set of WinXX and linux/unix hosts you will need to override this
in the per-PC config.pl.

The valid values are:

 - 'smb':     backup and restore via smbclient and the SMB protocol.
              Easiest choice for WinXX.

 - 'rsync':   backup and restore via rsync (via rsh or ssh).
              Best choice for linux/unix.  Good choice also for WinXX.

 - 'rsyncd':  backup and restore via rsync daemon on the client.
              Best choice for linux/unix if you have rsyncd running on
              the client.  Good choice also for WinXX.

 - 'tar':    backup and restore via tar, tar over ssh, rsh or nfs.
             Good choice for linux/unix.

Alias of `Enum['smb', 'rsync', 'rsyncd', 'tar']`
